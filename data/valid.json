Something that\u2019s stuck between mouth and stomach.  You do also have a very fast gag reflex in the back of your throat that can prevent things from going down your throat in the first place.   Your stomach has one of those \u201cgates\u201d and so you can start and stop a variety of functions there if you have to.   When you need to gag, a split-second decision is made - do you vomit or gag?   That is the feeling you are sensing in your stomach.

    "answer": "To expand on the question, in theory these techniques use destructive interference, correct? But if we have destructive interference at some position, don't we also have constructive interference somewhere else?   Because we are introducing more energy into the system to decrease the energy already in the system, all that energy needs to go somewhere. So if we want to remove energy from one position, we will double it at a different one.  Based on that, isn't it theoretically impossible to make noise canceling equipment that will completely remove a sound? All it can do is remove the sound from one area, and make it louder somewhere else. Less noise canceling, more noise shifting.",
    "follow-up": "This question can be easily answered by asking yourself a different question. Assuming this is correct, then why isn't noise cancelling actually loud? It does not make any noise to outsiders, nor does it make more noise than it \"stops\" for the user.  You can think of it as driving a car. Without noise cancelling there are no brakes, and if you want to stop fhe car all you can do is press the clutch down and let it coast. However, noise cancelling is like applying the brakes. Yes, the brakes introduce a bit of extra energy into the system. This can however be neglected by the fact that they remove a lot more energy from the system by stopping the car.",

It is not uncommon in the US for people to never travel out of their area, so the thought of moving to an entirely new area or state can be very overwhelming, especially if it is away from your social support network (friends and family).   From an abstract standpoint, these areas hold cultural value for the communities living there. It is someone's *home*. They don't want to just up and move away from it when their family has been there for generations.   On a larger scale, it is *extremely* expensive to relocate entire populations of people. There are towns in Alaska that are disappearing because the ocean levels are rising, and it will take tens of millions of dollars to move the people there.

But the simple truth is that salt is sodium cloride, and when in solution the sodium and cloride ions are free to move, sodium reacts with the bitter receptors on the tongue blocking them, so you cant sense bitter or sense bitter to a lesser extent when something has been salted.   Alton brown has shown on several occasions this effect on his show \"good eats\", you can add a small amount of salt to coffee or pomelo to block the bitterness so you can enjoy the flavour more, just careful since the chloride is still there and its what gives salt its salty flavour, so an excess will ruin the taste.",

Obviously in this case it's really quick and simple to go through all the possibilities, but if the numbers are large enough it defies the capabilities of even our fastest, most powerful computers.  And that's basically all that public-private key encryption involves. The public key is the \"answer\" to the problem (in this case 100), but unless you also know the two specific numbers that generated that public key, it's impossible to crack the code. And knowing the public key doesn't help you guess which two numbers were used to generate it, because there's no known mathematical shortcut to finding those two numbers.",

Because most standard alcoholic beverages work out to contain about that much, it's pretty convenient to use that as a base and much easier to keep track of (especially when you're, well, drunk)   After all, the unit is only meaningful if we can understand the effect it has on us. If you regularly drink coffee, and I hand you an energy drink that has 100 mg of caffeine, you won't know what to expect unless you compare that to the amount of caffeine in the coffee you usually drink.

You let that heat radiate into the air and blow it away, heating that side. You pump the liquid into the cold side, and then let it decompress back into a gas. That takes a lot of energy, which makes it cooler. The surrounding air heats it back up, and that cooler air is then circulated away, cooling that side.   Specifically on a minisplit, it is setup in such a way that allows it to flip which side is the evaporator side and which side is the condenser side.

    "question": "ELI5: How does the NFL work?",
    "answer": "First let's clarify some terms: NFL is the **league**. AFC and NFC are the two **conferences** in the league. And each conference is made up up of four **divisions**: East, West, South, North. Each division is made up of four teams.      **Regular Season**   Each team will play each other team in it's division twice during the regular season. Then each team is assigned two divisions from each conference to play. The team will play everyone in both divisions once during the season. The selected divisions rotate, so after 4 years every team has played every other team at least once. But it's less common to see an AFC team playing an NFC team since most of the games in a season are within the conference. Finally, each team will play two more games in the regular season: the team that ranked the same as them (from last season) from the two divisions within their conference that they did not play. That is how the season is determined and why the NFL is structured the way it is.    **Post Season**   After regular season, the teams with the best record from each division advance to the post season. In addition, among the teams that did not win their division, the three teams with the best overall record (not tied to division) within their conference get to advance. This is referred to as a **wild card**. This makes for a total of seven teams from each conference. The first round is called the **wild card playoffs** where the wild card teams play lower seeded teams for each conference whereas the top seed from each conference gets a bye week and doesn't have to play (so six teams play in wild card with one team automatically advancing). So after wild card playoffs, you have 3 teams emerge. Next they will play the **divisional playoffs**. The lowest remaining seed plays the top seed who got the bye week. And the other two seeds play each other. Top seed has a big advantage. Finally, you have the **AFC and NFC championships** where the two remaining teams play each other for the conference championships. Then after, finally, the Super Bowl where the presumably best teams from each conference play each other for the NFL championship.      **League / Team Changes**   Regarding your question about changing \"leagues\". No - because NFL is really the only real league around. This has been the case since the NFL and AFL merged in the 1970s (hence where we get NFC and AFC, they were formerly different leagues). Typically what happens is franchises move around to various cities. Houston Oilers became the Tennessee Titans, as an example. Occasionally, team deactivate or new expansion teams are formed, but NFL strongly prefers to keep the number of teams to 32, so typically this means it likes to pair those with other teams to keep it at 32.

    "question": "ELI5: Why is it common for teachers and nurses to unionize, but not, e.g., architects or lawyers?",
    "answer": "When you have a lot of people working for a single employer there arises the possibility where the employer could impose unfair wages or bad working conditions. So the workers collectively bargain with the employer to have better working conditions and pay - they form a union.   Architects are mostly self-employed or work in small studios, so there isn't a critical mass of workers that need to be organized. The same applies for lawyers in smaller law firms.    Engineers (IT mostly) and Lawyers in bigger law firms are highly sought after and work in a competitive field. They have the luxury of going away and working for someone else (in contrast to nurses and doctors  - there are only so many hospitals). Companies compete in providing the best perks to employees just to lure more of them in. So there is no need to form unions. At least not right now :)",

    "question": "eli5: What triggers the swap between winter and summer coats in animals?",
    "answer": "It's controlled by changes in the length of the day. As winter approaches, the days get shorter, and this triggers molting into winter fur (and vice versa when the days get longer in the spring). Mind you, it's not the light intensity or the total amount of sun energy received that's registered, but the relative lengths of the light and dark phases. This isn't a biological clock as such (but the mechanism that controls it is possibly connected to the *circadian* biological clock, which tells the body what time of day it is).  Because days are longer in the summer (and shorter in the winter) the farther you go from the equator, populations living at a certain latitude are genetically adapted so that they change to/from winter fur at a specific daylength that corresponds to the time of year when this is appropriate. So what happens if you move an animal like this to a warmer location depends on how you move it. If you move it somewhere that's significantly warmer but located to the east or west of its home, it'll keep changing its fur at the same dates as it used to. This is also true if the fox stays in place but the climate gets warmer, so that winter now comes later and spring comes earlier than before: the fox will still follow its genetically coded sun-based calendar, so it'll spend a steadily increasing part of the year wearing the wrong fur, with shitty camouflage as a result. This is a problem that's affecting snowshoe hares in North America right now.  If you move the animal north or south, things get a bit more complicated, because different day-lengths now occur at different times of year. Let's say you've got an arctic fox living in central Sweden, where days get down to 10 hours in mid-October; maybe that's a good time to start growing a winter fur. Move that fox down to France, you don't get to 10-hour days until the first week of November, so the fur change gets delayed. Move the fox to Nepal, days *never* get as short as 10 days even in mid-winter, so the fox would probably stay in its summer fur constantly, despite the abundant snow.  When an organism responds to the length of the day, it's called photoperiodism. It happens in lots of things. Insects use it to control when to go into hibernation; plants use it to control when to flower or prepare next year's buds. I'm a researcher working with photoperiodism in insects, so let me know if you have other questions about it.",

When we say pi is the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter, we don\u2019t mean we literally drew out a circle and measured it (although for centuries that was indeed how we calculated approximations for pi), we specifically care about the ratio for a mathematically pure circle which is a very well defined thing (the set of all points some distance *r* from a common centre-point). In fact in modern times we don\u2019t even use circles to calculate pi at all, we use something known as a series (basically just adding up an infinite amount of numbers) to calculate pi to high levels of precision. For example the reciprocal of all squares (1+1/4+1/9+1/16+\u2026) has been proven to approach the value pi^2/6, if we could add all infinite numbers in the series we would end up with exactly pi^2/6, allowing us to get a value for pi even though there seemingly isn\u2019t a circle in sight.

    "follow-up": "Wikipedia says \"there are explanations based directly on Newton's laws of motion and explanations based on Bernoulli's principle. Either can be used to explain lift.\"  Seems like both contribute: a wing turns the flow of air that moves over it downward, because of the angle of both its bottom and top sides, and also causes air to move faster above it than below. Both produce a net upward force from the air on the wing. Angle of attack and wing shape both affect how the air flows over the wing.  Which one counts for more? I dunno, i guess it varies? Planes that can fly upside down have relatively symmetrical cross-sections, so flipping them doesn't change much about either force, but other planes have very asymmetrical shapes and can generate lift even with a wing-bottom that's perfectly horizontal.  Also: the top of the wing also contributes to deflecting air, by \"pulling\" air down as it slopes down!  Idk if this comes off as know-it-all but I didn't know this until now and had to share",

    "answer": "They are both very similar. Both of them are amplifying DNA through use of PCR. The way DNA is amplified is that DNA is put in a tube with primers (sequences of DNA you want to amplify usually sense and antisense). The PCR machine will heat up DNA so that it denatures or split from the original double helix into single stranded DNA. This is where the primers come in by binding to the single standard DNA. The machine will then cool it down so that the strands anneal again/come back together and nucleotides will fill in the rest of the strand with primers and theoretically double the amount of specific DNA sequence every time. There are lots of different variables (annealing temp, primer efficiency, amount of cycles, amount of DNA, etc) that go into play but that\u2019s for another day.   So now we know what PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is. As far as I am understanding it, Nucleic acid test or nucleic acid amplification test seems to be encompassing reverse transcriptase PCR. So the reason why rtPCR is special is because you add an extra step. You extract RNA from specimen and reverse transcribe it into DNA through the use of a reverse transcriptase. Then it become like other DNA sample and you would do the same procedure as explained above.   The reason why we can\u2019t just run PCR on RNA is because RNA is extremely unstable and would denature too quickly.

    "answer": "Red, yellow, and blue are not *\"the\"* primary colors.  Primary colors are any limited set of colors that you mix together to simulate a wider range of *secondary* colors. If you have red, yellow, and blue paint which you mix on a pallet, then your primaries are RYB. If you have a printer that deposits cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks onto paper, then your primaries are CMYK. If you have a computer with an LCD screen made of red, green and blue pixels, then your primaries are RGB.  Computer screens use RGB because those are the base colors closest to what the human eye actually detects. What we see as yellow is just the simultaneous stimulation of red-sensitive nerves and green-sensitive nerves on our retinas. This can be stimulated by a wavelength of light that actually corresponds to the color yellow, or by a combination of red and green light.",

If you measured the heights of all adult males and made a histogram of the data, the graph would have a bell curve with the peak of the bell curve at the average height. Basically, it means that a lot of people are average height or close to average, fewer people are significantly taller or significantly shorter than average, and very few people are extremely tall or extremely short.  The normal distribution can be described with two numbers: mean and standard deviation. The mean says where the center of the bell curve is and the standard deviation says how wide it is. 68% of the population will be within plus or minus one standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the population with be within plus or minus two standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the population will be within plus or minus three standard deviations of the mean.",

It pumps water through the body pretty evenly (although blood vessels can expand and constrict to reduce blood flow to an area, which will also slightly reduce water flow). Each individual organ uses the water it needs, but the less water is available in total, the harder it is for any given organ to use it (this didn't need to evolve or be controlled by anything, this is just a fact of how something called osmosis works).

Sure, it's certainly possible to keep replacing components as they break, Ship of Theseus style.  But as it ages and things break more and more, eventually it will simply be a better option to build components for a whole new space station, send them up, put it together, and deorbit the ISS.

Arm hairs will stop growing after a couple of months, whereas the hair on the head grows for a few years before it stops.\r   \r   Hair growth occurs in phases. The first phase is called the anagen phase, and it's the only time that hair actively grows. How long your own anagen phase is will be dependent on your genes. This is why some people just can't grow beards, or can't ever seem to get their hair as long as they want it to be. The typical anagen phase for a healthy adult for head-hair is between 2 and 6 years, long enough to grow around 1 to 3 feet. The typical anagen phase for arm hair is between 3 and 8 weeks, maxing it out at one or two inches.\r   \r   Once the anagen phase is over, it enters into the catagen phase. All the growing is done, but you might actually gain a little bit of length hear as the follicle pushes the hair out before it begins to grow another strand of hair.\r   \r   After catagen comes telogen, the resting phase, where the follicle sits dormant for a while (up to several months). This is when the old, dead hair falls off/gets pushed out. After that, it goes back to the anagen phase.\r   \r   And thankfully, all of this is staggered all over our (human) bodies.

Right now, that is $1.26M in income, but what if the exchange rate changes?  If in 6 months \u20ac1M is only worth $900k you might take a loss on the sale.

Now, sometimes people will get even more complex - they may not like how much they have to pay for that option contract that protects their downside risk, so they will sell _their own_ option to recoup some of that cost.  They will sell and option that says they will sell \u20ac1M for $1.27M in six months and use that option sale to offset the cost of their previous option purchase.

    "answer": "Not directly answering the question but many people get force and energy confused.   A force can exist forever and requires nothing to maintain. Energy only comes in when the force is able to do/move something. A magnet can apply a magnetic force and hold on to your hand from now until eternity if you ignore the physical materials degrading. You holding up an object is not quite the same.   Your muscles are constantly moving little strands by tightening and releasing them. This is why (in part) it takes energy and you get tired. Some creatures are able to move their body such that it \"latches\" into place and no longer requires any energy or effort to hold in position.",

    "answer": "A couple things. For one, dynamic drivers are widely used and understood, relatively simple and cheap to produce. They can also be made quite small, and don't need a lot of power to run them.  Their versatility is what makes them so common. Planar drivers on the other hand tend to be bigger, heavier, and costly.  Plus they often need an amp to run. (but not always)  The advantage of a planar driver is that the membrane that makes the sound can be incredibly lightweight which allows for clearer, less distorted sound.   But just like with a lot of things, it's a game of trade-offs.  Planar headphones also often tend to be open backed.  A lot of people like this, but that makes them harder to use in a noisy environment and means they bleed more.",

    "question": "[ELI5] How does the force of gravity actually work? Why does something just having more mass means it has the ability to pull things to it?",
    "answer": "Our current best understanding of gravity oisgeneral relativity.  The idea is that space and time are not two independent components of reality, but are just two facets of the same thing, called (very originally) spacetime.  You know these 2D graphs where you can represent position as time goes by? That's the same idea but you have three dimensions for space and still one for time. It's pretty hard to visualize, but the math describes it pretty well.  Anything that exists always moves in spacetime. And if no external forces applied, it follows a straight line. If there are no massive object nearby and we are immobile, that's a straight line that only moves in time, one second every second that passes. If the object is moving, the line is angled a bit through space, but still straight by our standard definition.  When a force is applied, it accelerates the object and bends its trajectory.  Now, when something with mass exists, it bends spacetime. The axis of the graph aren't as straight anymore.  To have a representation of that, take a sheet and a strip of paper (say, half an inch wide for the strip, it's important that it has some width, not the exact measure).  If you lay the sheet flat on the table and the strip flat against it and trace one of the sides of the strip. That's a straight line on a flat surface.  Now, roll the sheet in a cone (i.e, with one pointy bit). Again lay the strip of paper flat against the cone, going a bit around it (you can go as vertical as could be, but that's not gonna illustrate my point) and trace one of the sides of the strip. That's a straight line on a curved surface. If you unroll the sheet of paper and have a look at that line, you'll quickly notice, something funky is going on.  Why we do we use this particular definition for straight lines? Because that's the one that preserves quite a bit of nice mathematical properties. And because it fits quite nicely with our description of physics.  In particular, within spacetime an object without external forces applied on it will always follow one such straight line. By the way, they are called geodesics when talking about potentially curved surfaces.  How does that relates to gravity? Well, as you saw if the surface of the sheet of paper is curved, the straight line deviates when we unroll the sheet of paper.  We humans don't really have the ability the perceive and be aware of the curvature of spacetime. So, from our point of view, it looks like there is a force applied by massive objects that attracts stuff around them.  When in reality, it looks more like the mass curved spacetime and the objects keep going forward along their geodesics. Which are bent because of the curvature.  We can test that because the standard (i.e, Newtonian) model of gravity, where it actually is a force, has a few flaws that don't match reality. Light and some planets don't follow the path they should. But general relativity, while it sounds more complexe, actually produces the paths we observe, along with a lot of other interesting phenomenons that we have been able to confirm since (e.g., gravitational waves)",

    "answer": "When you say or think of a word (for example, \u201cpink\u201d), it creates a sensation in your brain. That sensation is electric impulses traveling from neuron to neuron in a specific, complex network that your brain accepts and registers as \u201cpink\u201d. However, during the travel of the electric impulse, your neurons release certain chemicals, and those chemicals need to be restored. This is known as \u201creuptake.\u201d  Thus, when you first think \u201cpink,\u201d all the neurons used to create that thought are all strong and ready to give you a nice, strong, comprehensive, and clear idea of pink. However, after immediately triggering those neurons over and over and over, while your neurons are still in the reuptake process, they get, \u201ctired out\u201d in a way, and aren\u2019t all able to perform as expected.   Duly note; neurons firing is like a gun firing; they either do or don\u2019t. They can\u2019t half fire and create a weak image. Instead, the idea of pink gets less and less clear as less and less neurons are working to create the image until they all \u201cpass out\u201d and you\u2019re left thinking \u201c...what IS pink?\u201d",

Salt water has more stuff in it than fresh water -- the salt takes up space between the water molecules.

    "answer": "So essentially, in the ocean and seas, water is constantly evaporating.  When it evaporates, it's mostly salt free, as the salt doesn't go with water vapor.  It turns into clouds as it gathers together, then goes inland and rains.  Man made desalination works similar.  Except accelerated and in a much smaller surface area.  We heat up the water.  That causes it to evaporate quickly, and we collect the water vapor, and get fresh water.    The residue of the man made desalination process is very salty water.  Which gets pumped back into the ocean, and can cause issues with the area it gets pumped into getting too salty and killing off everything.  The limitation is cost.  It takes a huge amount of energy to heat up water to produce enough fresh water to be usable.  That huge amount of energy is very expensive.",

    "question": "ELI5: How is electricity physically measured (like at the meter on my house)?",
    "answer": "Maybe not ELI5, but here you go.  Electricity is the flow of electrons.   Electrons flow because they are pushed by a *voltage*. The voltage is like the pressure causes water to flow in a pipe.  The amount of electrons that flow is termed the *current*. The current is like the flowrate of water in the pipe.  More voltage (pressure) = more current (flow).  So if you want to talk about flow, you might say there are 10 electrons travelling past a point every second (electrons per second), just like how you might talk about water flow in litres or gallons per second.  If you want to find the total volume of water, you take the flow and multiply it by time. So if you had 10 litres per second, after 100 seconds you used 10\u00d7100=1000 litres.  Same for electricity. You take the amperage, and multiply it by time. We could do electrons per second, but we use Amperes to measure current. We also use hours instead of seconds.  So what do you get when you multiply Amperes and Hours? Ampere-hour (Ah), which is what you see on your electricity bill. The ampere-hour is the amount of electricity you used.  Now we know how you measure time, but what about current?  Inside your meter is a *current transformer*. This consists of a metal donut that surrounds the main conductor going into your house. A copper wire is coiled around the donut.  The electricity going through the main conductor is AC (*alternating current*). Now when electricity flows, it creates a magnetic field. When that current *alternates*, so does the magnetic field. So you have an *alternating magnetic field* surrounding the main conductor. This fluctuating magnetic field causes magnetic field lines to pass through that copper coil in your little current transformer, and that *induces* a small current in the copper coil.  This copper coil is connected to a smarter device which includes an ammeter which measures the current. This is then used to calculate the current in the main conductor.  The current \u00d7 time calculation is done at small intervals and added together to account for varying loads.",

Note that sometimes a wild card team could actually have a better record than a division winner (from a different division obviously), but they are still seeded lower. This didn't happen this year, but some years where there is a weak division winner, and more than one very strong team in another division, it could happen.  In the first round (called the Wild Card round), the 1 seed gets a bye--they advance directly to the next round. The other seeds are paired up: 2 vs 7, 3 vs 6, and 4 vs 5, with the game hosted by the higher seed.  The second round (called the Divisional Round) feature the 1 seed and the three winners. The 1 seed hosts the lowest remaining seed, while the other two play at the higher seed. So in the AFC this year, where 2, 3, and 4 won the Wild Card games, it became 1v4 and 2v3. In the NFC, where 2, 4, and 6 won, it became 1v6 and 2v4.  The third round (called the Conference Championship) is played by the remaining two teams in each conference, hosted by the higher seed. In the AFC, it is between 2v4 (so hosted by the 2 seed, Kansas City), while in the NFC, it is 4v6 (so hosted by the 4 seed, Los Angeles).  Then finally the winners from each conference play in the Super Bowl.",

    "answer": "Before even considering that ocean water is salty, water is **heavy**. Pumping it out of the ocean means giving it gravitational potential energy, and on the scale we'd need to do that it's completely infeasible. Let's do some math.  Take a top of the line, 4th gen, 1000MW nuclear reactor (or any non fossil fuel power supply). I'll pull two numbers out of my butt and say we need to raise the ocean water 50m to get it to our artificial lake, and that there are no losses moving the water--meaning all the 1000MW becomes potential energy. One m^(3) of water is 1000kg and raising it 50m takes 500,000 Joules, or more conveniently 0.5MW to pump 1 m^(3) per second. That means we can pump 2000m^(3)/sec out of the ocean. Even bigger than that is that we're pumping 63 billion m^(3) out of the ocean every year.   Unfortunately for us, even bigger than that last number is the amount of water in the ocean. The oceans cover 510 million square kilometers and sucking out those 63 billion cubic meters only lowers the level by about 0.12mm (0.005 inches in Freedom Units). Sea level rise over the past decade has been about 3.5 mm/year. That means just to stay even with sea level rise, we would need 30 new power plants that effectively do nothing since all their power is pumping water. I don't see the will for that happening anytime soon, and if that will does appear we'll still need to answer the questions \"Where are we putting all this water?\" and \"What are we doing about the salt?\"  Please don't take this reply to harsh. The suggestion doesn't work right of the bat, but it's not a dumb question.",

    "answer": "I think he's asking why radio can interfere with copper and not fiber. Copper acts like an antenna so it can pickup voltage from any RF it's exposed to. Nearby wires even cause \"crosstalk\". AM radio can rectify almost directly to an audible signal on the lines. Just depends what exactly you're exposing copper to.  That's why shielded cables and metal conduit are needed for some applications.  Fiber is either glass or plastic. It's radio transparent and so doesn't pickup signal from \"EM\" around it.  It transmits data in light. Technically an EM wave but it usually doesn't induce a voltage on copper.   What are you doing that refers to RF interference as EM waves?",
    "follow-up": "I see, thanks. So basically the way RF transmission works (copper or over the air), it induces electromagnetic fields that can mess with each other.

    "question": "ELI5: How does Encryption actually work?",
    "answer": ">By making computer chips faster aren't we directly making encryption obsolete?  Ehhh only to an extent  Encryption schemes rely on math that is fairly easy to do forwards if you have the key, but insanely difficult to reverse to figure out the message without the key or determine the key from the encrypted message  The most straightforward way to break encryption is to figure out the key.  If we look at something common like AES 256, it has a 256 bit key which means the key is one of 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936 or roughly 10^77 different values.  You can see that's a pretty large number  If you could test 1 billion keys (10^9) per second then it would take 2x10^50 ages of the universe to test them all.  Statistically you'll find it half way through so you *only* have to wait 10^50 ages of the universe.  Even if you make the computer a billion times faster so it can test 10^18 keys per second you'll still need to wait 10^41 ages of the universe.  Its close enough to impossible that the more practical way to get it is as this [xkcd describes](https://xkcd.com/538/) and is sometimes called [Rubber-hose cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis)  The weakest part of most security systems is the meatbag in the middle",

    "question": "ELI5 please ! : What type of genetic characteristics does a single sperm have ? Does it already have an eye color ?",
    "answer": "A person has two copies of most genes.  Each of the person's gametes (i.e. sperm or eggs) will have one of that person's copies.  A version of a gene is called an \"allele\".  In the simplest case, a trait would be determined solely by whether a given allele is present or absent.  For example, imagine that eye color were determined by a single gene, and specifically by whether you had an allele of that gene which instructs your body to \"add melanin (i.e. brown pigment) to the iris\": if you had one or two copies of this allele, you would end up with melanized (i.e. brown) eyes; if you had no copies of this allele, you would end up with unmelanized (i.e. blue) eyes.  So there are six possibilities:  1. If both parents are blue-eyed, then none of their gametes will have the iris-melanization allele, so all of their children will also end up blue-eyed. 2. Likewise, if both parents are brown-eyed-with-two-copies, then all of their gametes will have one copy of the allele, so all of their children will also end up brown-eyed-with-two-copies. 3. If one parent is blue-eyed and the other is brown-eyed-with-two-copies, then all of the blue-eyed parent's gametes will lack the allele and all of the brown-eyed parent's gametes will have it, so all of their children will end up brown-eyed-with-one-copy. 4. If one parent is blue-eyed and the other is brown-eyed-with-one-copy, then all of the blue-eyed parent's gametes will lack the allele and *half* of the brown-eyed parent's gametes will have it, so each child will have a 50% chance of being blue-eyed and a 50% chance of being brown-eyed-with-one-copy. 5. Likewise, if one parent is brown-eyed-with-two-copies and the other is brown-eyed-with-one-copy, the first parent's gametes will all have one copy and so will half of the second parent's gametes.  So each child will have a 50% chance of being brown-eyed-with-two-copies and a 50% chance of being brown-eyed-with-one-copy. 6. If both parents are brown-eyed-with-one-copy, then half of each parent's gametes will have one copy and the other half will not.  So each child will have a 25% chance of being blue-eyed, a 50% chance of being brown-eyed-with-one-copy, and a 25% chance of being brown-eyed-with-two-copies.  Of course, in reality, it's very rare for a trait to only be affected by a single gene.  For example, in addition to the gene telling your body whether to add melanin to the iris, there's also a gene that tells your body how to make melanin in the first place.  If neither of your alleles for that gene worked very well, you would end up with the genetic condition known as \"albinism\", making you blue-eyed (and blond-haired and pink-skinned) regardless of how many alleles you had instructing your body to add melanin to the iris.  Also, some genes are located on the X-chromosome, the Y-chromosome, or in the mitochondrion.  These will have different inheritance patterns.  For example, men can have at most one copy of the allele for \"distinguish red light from green light\" (this is why red-green color-blindness is so much more common in men than in women), and a man who does have a copy will pass it on to all of his daughters and none of his sons.",

    "question": "ELI5 - How fast do our eyes capture images? Like how many \"pictures per second\" get sent to the brain?",
    "answer": "Basically, there is not necessarily a maximum frequency. We also do not see in \"frames\" - that is, we don't see a series of still images in rapid succession that looks like a continuous \"video\".  Each of our retinal ganglion cells (our \"seeing\" cells) is connected to our brain. When it is exposed to a change in light (very oversimplified for ELI5), these seeing cells send a signal to our brain. This happens all the time in all of our seeing cells, even when our eyes are closed, and there are millions and millions of these cells, each firing (mostly) on their own.   Our brain receives all of this continuously and extracts details, like edges and shapes, and then assembles these into a \"mental image\" that we experience as vision. It's actually one of the best understood systems in the brain, and has been studied for over a century. This happens continuously, and we experience it as a continual \"stream of vision\", where-as a video quickly take pictures over and over again and then plays them back to create the illusion of continuity.  So you can see why we can't quite say, \"humans see in XX Hz\". The way our eyes work to create vision is fundamentally different from how cameras work to create videos.  EDIT: I found a [scientific article](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07861) that claims human subjects could detect a single altered frame in 500 FPS video. This doesn't mean we \"see\" in 500 FPS; instead it means our sight cells and brain are sensitive enough to catch a frame that was visible for only 0.02 seconds. It's like how you can run your finger along a piece of wood and find a tiny spot that's rough through touch alone; our brain looks for patterns in the visual information coming from our eyes, and if that pattern is broken our brain is very good at detecting it and making us aware of it.",
    "follow-up": "Great information!   Question. As for the brain processing each of the cells, would this be similar to \"active matrix\" displays?  (As if our eye pixels/cells were like this but capturing light instead of displaying it)  Wiki - \" Active matrix is a type of addressing scheme used in flat panel displays. In this method of switching individual elements (pixels), each pixel is attached to a transistor and capacitor actively maintaining the pixel state while other pixels are being addressed, in contrast with the older passive matrix technology in which each pixel must maintain its state passively, without being driven by circuitry. \"   And then with all these \"pixels\" being independently updated, our brain makes up an image - which is why we sometimes see things that aren't there or get tricked by optical illusions?",

    "question": "ELI5: Assuming someone has no musical background, what is happening in their brains that enables them to \"hear\" or determine the next note of a scale?",
    "answer": "Sound travels in waves and waves by definition have an element of repetition, something is happening over and over again a certain number of times per second for example.   In the case of sound waves the note, or tone, that we hear corresponds to rate of this repetition. So for example, if I make air vibrate 440 times per second, I will produce a tone we arbitrarily call \"A\" in music.    You understand that our musical scale has \"repeating\" notes in an octave. What's happening in our ears that makes one A similar, but different, from other As is the waves are 2x multiples of each other. So what we call octaves, are doubling the wave's frequencies. So 440 is an \"A\". So are 220 and 880.  The *whateveritis* that makes As sound \"the same but different\" is that they are multiples of the frequency. The same property with Bs and Cs and Gs. Double or halve a B and you got higher, or lower, Bs.  What makes notes sound nice together is when the waves line up together. I clap once per second, and you clap once every 1.5 seconds, we will clap together every 3 seconds. When you make sounds that overlap cleanly like, it sounds nice. If you start at a given frequency, say a C tone, and start playing a second frequency ascending upwards, 440, 441, 442, 443, etc. It'll sound like garbage. UNTIL you reach a specific frequency that suddenly sounds nice. We'll name that D. Then you keep going and you'll reach another pretty sound, we'll call that E. If you look at the frequencies that sound nice, you'll realize they aren't random, they are those moments where the sound waves line up in a special way. Eventually you'll reach the frequency of double-C and process starts again. This is how our music scales are created. It's a bit more complicated than this but you get the idea.   Finally, the human brain is pretty good at pattern recognition. If start at C, and go to D, E, F, it'll \"learn\" the pattern that's happening with the sound waves (even if you don't know the names of music notes or how they work) and start predicting the next element in the pattern.",

Also, many insurance companies increase premiums as person gets older. So, you may start by paying $1800 per year, but that might go to up $2000 per year by the time you turn 40. Since you are closer to death at that point, they require more money from you to offset the higher risk they take.

By the time you're an adult you already *know*, through experience, what'll happen if you do things like that, so you know to use less force on it than you would a jellybean or something.    You aren't \"understanding\" the physics, you're just recognizing that different properties require different amounts of force to handle without breaking them apart.    Have you ever been handed something deceptively heavy or light, where you have to adjust the amount of strength your using so it doesn't hit the floor or fly into the air once handed to you? That's because you don't know the properties if it so you *assume* it's like other objects of it's size, which can be very wrong at times and force you to adjust on-the-fly.",

But in regards to this latest anomaly, my understanding is that the tests are seeing the expected byproducts of these particular collisions and those byproduct particles are reasonably well understood and they're fairly confident in what they're seeing. The issue is that the ratio that those two byproducts are being produced seems to be slightly different than the prediction.   That doesn't completely rule out some sort of experimental error, which is why they're going to do more testing, and hopefully either figure out what the problem is, or just build more confidence in the fact that muons are acting unexpectedly.",

    "answer": "The variability between the water droplets size, shape, etc., is pretty small, and each individual drop's effect on the overall rainbow is drowned by the overall number of drops. You're barely getting any color/refraction/reflection through each individual droplet; it's the overall mass of droplets that produce the effect. Unless all the drops in a certain area are similarly \"deformed\", the disturbance to the overall effect will be minimal.",
    "follow-up": "Gotcha. So (I put a similar reply below) -- is this then, basically a \"statistical\" effect where the coherence comes from the fact that the water droplets have some statistical distribution of shapes whose mode is let's say roughly spherical -- so the angle of reflection  of any given light wave similarly has a highly concentrated distribution?  It just occurred to me as well, that any significant variations from the modal angle of incidence (e.g. from misshapen droplets, or light waves occasionally passing through multiple droplets and getting re-reflected, etc.) may simply result in \"random light noise\" which could appear as whitish or grayish.

    "answer": "Let's do the math!  * The brightness of a star is proportional to 1/distance^(2).  * The Sun illuminates Earth with a total brightness of about 1.3 kW per square meter. * A dilated healthy pupil has a diameter of about 8 mm. So looking directly at the sun with a dilated pupil would, aside from being very painful, allow about 270 milliwatts of power into your eye. * If the Sun were 10 parsecs away, it would be about as bright as a dim star in the sky.  So, to compute the amount of *power* entering the eye from a dim star:  270 mW / (10 parsec / current distance to sun)^2 = 6.4 x 10^-14 W.  Then we just need to divide by the average energy of a photon of visible light, or about 4 x 10^-19 J. This gives us a ballpark estimate of about 160,000 photons (per second, since we were measuring energy per second a moment ago).   That's actually quite a long way above the threshold of vision, which can be stimulated by only a hundred or so - the limiting factor to seeing a star in the sky is the background light in the atmosphere, not your raw dark vision. A sealed room is much darker than the night sky.  EDIT: Sorry, I was using raw sunlight in space - only about 1 kW/m^2 makes it to the ground. So my number's high by about 30%. But there are probably other sources of error here too.",

There's no such thing as a truly stationary observer, but I'm assuming you mean stationary \\*relative to the source\\*. The way that we both see the same speed of light is that time moves differently depending on your relative speed. We have a light source at A, an observer at B that's stationary relative to A, and we're moving towards A (so we have some speed relative to both A and B). Because we're moving relative to B, time moves more slowly for us than for B. When the math dust all settles, we measure exactly the same speed for light.",

You could just get 100 random people with college degrees, make them run the 100 metres, time them and then get 100 random people without college degrees, make them do the same and then compare the two averages.  But there are quite a few problems with this. Let's just take one problem - age. Younger people (say in their 20s, 30s, 40s) are more likely to have a college degree than older people in their 60s, 70s, and 80s because more people got to college now than did 40+ years ago. So your 100 random college graduates are likely younger than your 100 random non-college graduates.  We know that, on average, younger people will run the 100m faster than older people so the college graduates will probably run faster than the non-college graduates just because they're younger. So you have to control for age as a factor. You can do that really simply by making your groups not so random. Make sure your college graduates and non-college graduates have the same age ranges and numbers.  By controlling for age, you're stopping age being a factor which affects your result.",
    "follow-up": "Isn't the phrase more commonly used for after-the-fact, statistical methods rather than sample selection?

    "answer": "Basically the classical understanding of gravity is a universal force that attracts all objects with mass to each other.  Not just objects to the earth but any 2 objects with mass.  Planets to the sun, 2 rocks floating next to each other in space whatever.  Like all fundamental forces we don\u2019t know how it works.  But there are anomalies, such as the effect of black holes on light.  Light has no mass and so should not be effected but it is.  The quantum physics/relativity explanation is that all objects made of matter cause space/time to bend around them and the effect that this curvature has on material and energetic bodies ( light, radio waves, stuff) is what we experience as gravity",

Individual solar cells can be much higher in efficiency, but cost factors and loses in the panel bring that down.  But efficiency is only part of the equation.  Solar panels require a great deal of space to generate a significant amount of power, while traditional power stations are much much smaller in terms of land area.  Solar Panels have a minimal environmental impact though.  Nuclear power meanwhile is the most energy dense, you get the most power out of a small amount of fuel.

She stated this belief in a way that was non-harassing, non-bullying, however, trans people were offended by her simply holding this belief and lobbied to have her terminated from her employment.  Which was successful.  The court found in her favor because she was not calling for discriminations, totalitarian acts or repressive acts when she stated her belief.   She did not propagate violence or harassments towards transgendered people.  Nor does she have a history of doing so.

    "answer": "It's not the voltage that kills you; it's the amperage.  \"Voltage\" refers to the potential difference between two spots; loosely, how \"motivated\" electricity is to move from the higher voltage to the lower voltage. You can think of it as electric \"pressure,\" similar to water pressure in a pipe, if you want.  \"Amperage\" refers to the volume of electricity being moved *by* that pressure. Returning to our water analogy, amperage can be viewed as how much water is being moved through the pipe.  It should be relatively intuitive that it's the amount of electricity that kills, rather than how much pressure is being exerted on the electricity to make it move.",
    "follow-up": ">It's not the voltage that kills you; it's the amperage.   Misleading. Amperage is a function of voltage. Saying it's not the voltage that kills you is like saying \"it's not the fall that kills you, it's the sudden stop at the end.\" While technically true, it's completely misleading to say that voltage doesn't kill you. A layman may not understand that a high voltage power source is far less safe than a low voltage power source, even if the high voltage source is limited to a lower amperage.   There's a reason they don't teach this saying in schools anymore    Would you rather touch a 120 household circuit limited to 20A, or a 480v industrial circuit limited to 3A? Exactly.",

    "answer": "Mobile carriers make their money off the contract you have with them, not the phones. They are willing to essentially give away a new phone in order to keep you as a customer.   I looked up the average cell phone bill and got answers ranging from about $70 a month to about $115 a month (no clue how accurate these are). A brand new iPhone costs around $800 to $1000. At the low end of the average bill you are paying $840 per year, at the high end it is $1,380. They still make money even if they give you a free phone.  This is essentially a concept called a \"loss leader.\" A loss leader is a product that is sold at a price below its market cost to stimulate other sales of more profitable goods or service.  A good example of this is the Costo Rotisserie Chicken. Costo is an American retail store chain that requires a membership and primarily sells in bulk. They famously sell a rotisserie chicken for $4.99, which is less than it costs Costco to make a rotisserie chicken; they lose money on every one. Costco sells them for this price because they are betting, usually correctly, that when you go into the store to buy a chicken you will end up buying something else that they *do* make money on.  Another common one is when a fast food restaurant offers a seemingly too good to be true deal. For example Burger King used to have a promotion called \"Whopper Wednesday\" where you could get a Whopper sandwich for just $1. The reasoning behind this was that people would show up to get the $1 Whopper, and then would also buy fries and a drink, both of which are items with a large profit margin.  TL;DR: T-Mobile makes its money on the contract you sign, not on selling the phone, and is willing to pretty much give the phone away to keep you as a customer.",

What if you desperately need milk, but all you have is a sheaf of wheat and the only person who has a milk cow doesn't need wheat. Only nails. So you go to the smith for nails but his wheat crop came in great. He does know someone down the road who needs a little wheat and has some sugar he would happily take for the nails. So you have to go trade the wheat for sugar, then the sugar for nails, then the nails for milk.   Alternatively you could have just given the milk maid a slip of paper that says \"this is worth one sheaf of wheat, 10 nails, a gallon of milk, or a half pound of sugar\" and they can use that whenever they decide to, to go buy anything they need of that value.   Currency is essentially a bartering IOU that everyone agrees is worth a specific quantity of a specific good.   In this case gold.   We assigned every item a trade value in gold.

    "answer": "That has got to do with the binding energy of the core. Now what is binding energy? It's essentially the energy that you need to break a core apart.  Now why is that important, well one could assume that the weight of a core is the same as the sum of weights of it's consituent parts, but it isn't. The core is usually lighter than the sum of it's parts, which is call mass defect.   Now according to Einstein and his famous formula E=mc\u00b2, mass (m) and energy (E) are directly related through a constant (c=speed of light), so you essentially a difference in energy between the core and what you'd get if you break it apart. Which is aptly called the \"binding energy\". So it's essentially the energy that you get by having a core over having parts.   Meaning the creation of the core released energy and to break apart the core you'd need to resupply it with energy. So if you look at the graph displaying the binding energy of cores per nucleon (parts of the core), you'll find this:  https://opentextbc.ca/universityphysicsv3openstax/chapter/nuclear-binding-energy/  So if you take 2 hydrogen atoms (consisting of a proton and a neutron) with a binding energy of ~1MeV per nucleon and fuse them to make helium (consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons or the the stuff in 2 hydrogens) then you realize that you went from 1MeV/nucleon for \u00b2H to 7MeV per nucleon for \u2074He. So you start from 4 nucleons at 1MeV = 4MeV to 4 nucleons at 7MeV = 28MeV now removing the 4MeV to break up the hydrogens you get 24MeV of energy from that reaction. Consersely if you break idk U235 into Ba142 and Kr91 the difference is much smaller let's say U235 are very roughly around ~7.5MeV and the other two are very roughly ~8.5MeV than you'd get a ~1MeV per nucleon which sounds like way less but you'd get that 235 times.  So as long as the result of either fusion or fission ends up having a higher binding energy than the stuff you fused or broke apart you would gain the difference in binding energy. However if you look closely iron is the core with the highest binding energy so both fusion and fission would require not provide you with energy.",

In terms of vinyl, the sounds which are vibrations of pressure in air are converted to a vibrating needle which cuts a groove on the vinyl. During replay, the needle vibrates according to the groove and that vibration is converted back to sound using electronics.   In digital recordings, the sound is converted to a series of numbers and stored in a data file. Because the sound that our ears can perceive are actually quite limited, the digital recording device needs to sample sound at something like 40,000 times a second to get enough data to reproduce the sound quite faithfully.",

Over time, these atoms decay--in other words, because they are unstable, they release specific particles from their nucleus. This decay happens at a specific known rate. Geologists can take samples of rock and look for the products resulting from the decay, and depending on how much of those radioactive decay products exist, they can estimate the age of the rock.

    "question": "ELI5: Can someone explain New Materialism to me?",
    "answer": "New materialism is an emerging approach to literary theory, philosophy, and the social sciences that counters the predominant focus on the social construction of knowledge/reality/meaning. It is basically a way of understanding reality that is grounded in systems of matter and energy. Whereas other perspectives view humans as agentic and the physical world as a passive entity that humans act upon, new materialism rejects the subject/object dichotomy and argues that agency is inherent in all forms of matter, not just humans. Objects, infrastructures, and discourses shape human action as well. Jane Bennett in her book *Vibrant Matter* refers to this inherent agency as the \"vitality of things\". Every action is a collaboration or interaction of different beings, objects, and forces. Basically, if you were to pick up a baseball and throw it through your annoying neighbor's window, a new materialist would not just see it as a human breaking a window- your neighbor prompts a negative reaction in you, and through your reaction you are enacting your agentic power to break a window through affecting another object, the baseball, creating an assemblage of things whose effect is to break the window. That's not a very good example, but maybe it helps you get the picture? The idea isn't exactly that humans are not responsible for their actions, but more that thinking in terms of assemblages of different material things allows a fuller understanding of different events, actions, and outcomes. This perspective sees the material world as relational, heterogenous, and dynamic. Reality emerges from a complex web of relations and processes between people and objects. \r   \r   That's my understanding after doing a little bit of searching on it! I'm a sociology student and I wasn't very familiar with the term but realized I have encountered some new materialist theory, like Bennet and other similar ideas in the realm of science & technology studies. I'm not sure if this is super helpful because new materialism is not a succinct field or approach but an emerging idea and its application will look different depending on what you're writing about.

Nothing that you need in order to understand an atomic bomb.        > What exactly does \u201csplitting an atom\u201d mean?         It means handing a big fat atom something it can't hold, so it splits into two smaller atoms of different elements.        Every element (eg hydrogen, carbon, uranium) is made up of atoms. An atom is the smallest piece of an element you can have: for a long time we thought that was the smallest thing you could get to.  It turns out that atoms are made of smaller things: protons, neutrons and electrons.  Hydrogen is made of atoms which have 1 proton, helium is made of atoms with 2 protons, and so it goes. Some elements come in more than one \"flavour\": all the atoms of that element will have exactly the same number of protons as each other, but they won't necessarily have the same number of neutrons.  Some numbers of neutrons make the atom stable, some make it unstable.        Unstable atoms tend to spit out a neutron. It's not good for us to have neutrons flying through the cells of our bodies and hitting the atoms in our DNA molecules.  I mean, there's always *a bit* of it happening, but it's not good for us.       It's even *worse* for us if that neutron hits another unstable atom (or gets absorbed by a stable atom, turning it into an unstable one).  Because here we can get a chain reaction.       All bombs work by chain reactions but these ones are particularly nasty.  Neutron hits atom, atom becomes unstable, atom *splits* into two smaller atoms.  Out comes some energy which is no longer needed to hold the big atom together, and also some neutrons.  Those neutrons slam into other molecules, making them horribly unstable, so *those* atoms split.  This releases a bit of energy and some neutrons, which fly into other atoms, and so it goes. The little bursts of energy add up, and there are a staggering number of them.  Everything is burned for km around, the air becomes intensely hot, which causes rapid expansion, which becomes a shock wave, which sends walls and cars and limbs flying.          The smaller radioactive atoms left over when the big one splits are also sent out in every direction and find themselves caught up in hair, in clothes, in the grass that cows eat, in the rivers and the earth and the sky.        Back to the bomb.  An atomic bomb works by squeezing enough of the radioactive element together into one place so that the neutrons which get spat out will cause other atoms to split, and that the neutrons from *those* atoms will cause *other* atoms to split, etc.  It's not easy to do, because when you start bringing the stuff together it will tend to blow itself apart in a little flash.  You need to do it very quickly and very precisely.  That was a big part of the challenge of making an atomic bomb.       Now, in a separate question, you should ask about nuclear bombs and fusion.",

    "answer": "Some pairs of characteristics of a particle or system cannot be both known with arbitrary precision simultaneously.  This is not an engineering problem (i.e., we don't need new technology) or even a physics issue (i.e., we need a better representation of reality). It's more fundamental than that.   The most common example is position and speed of a particle. By definition, speed is how much position changes over time (or over some stretch of space). So if you want to know the speed of something with extreme precision, you will need to know the various positions of something over a short period of time.  So when trying to determine speed, you have to include some incertitude on the position since it's changing.  On the other hand, if you want to know the precise position, you will need to be exact about what instant in time you're talking about. Essentially unable to specify the speed.  Speed is spread out in space and time, position is a point. You can't have both.  If we accept some loss of precision, then we can find a trade-off that allows us to talk about both. For example, the particle is in that bit of space and goes to that speed for the time it's in it.   Another example is the position and frequency of a wave.  A wave is by definition spread in space. A wave with a simple frequency is infinitely extending and had no position. You can add multiple frequencies together and their interference will produce a wave with a more limited spread. But the more you want precision on the position of the wave, the more frequencies you need to add. So against, you can't be precise about both at the same time.   Every time you end up with this sort of interaction it's an instance of the Heisenberg principle.",

I suppose you can't make two measurements of time and position, and derive speed at the second measurement, giving you the speed at the second measurement? This wouldn't work for some reason? I suppose if the speed changes upon measurement, you'd need to know exactly by how much. If the speed is constant, then this should theoretically work?",

It's also just such an interesting revelation that mass is (constrained) energy (the c^(2) is just a unit conversion, you could create a new unit system in which c=1 and so E=m).

How dangerous is the exploit?  &#x200B;  In the specific case of preventing news outlets from printing inaccurate and misleading content, solutions commonly require some external arbitrator and rules that determine what the press is allowed to say, and the punishments for saying the prohibited things.  Who is this arbitrator? Who sets the rules?  We don't yet have a good answer, and thus we struggle to have ideal news outlets.  Western societies don't like having governments control what is acceptable speech.  It becomes too easy for the government to enslave the press as a propaganda machine that says the government is always correct.  Many countries have a media regulator that can handle cases of egregious inaccuracy, but we are finding that these regulators are slow to act, cannot keep up with the volume of content produced in the modern ecosystem (the regulator is hundreds of employees, media employs hundreds-of-thousands of people), frequently have trouble with media networks obfuscating news vs entertainment content, and have penalties that are too small to dissuade bad behaviour.  Overall, the increasing inaccuracy in media is, I think, driven by the internet and smartphones making human attention divided such that news organisations compete for attention, which can be best done by shocking and angering content rather than careful analysis.  Solving this requires a re-education of the population as media consumers, or a complete overhaul of an entire private business sector, by regulation, to prevent ad-driven viral stories as motivation.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are ADHD drugs good for ADHDers but bad for neurotypical people?",
    "answer": "I've been medicated for ADHD most of my life.  As a child I tried Concerta and Ritalin, and then took Adderall from adolescence into early adulthood.  In my early 20s I stopped taking the meds because the side effects were becoming harder to manage, but in my mid 20s I went back and sought more professional help and am now taking Vyvanse.  The Vyvanse is by far the best of the ADHD meds I've tried, both in terms of how well it works and the side effects, and I'm really happy that I didn't give up entirely on medication helping me.  I tell you this because you shouldn't expect the meds to be an instant fix, they take some getting used to and you may end up trying a different medication down the road.  And that's totally fine, if not expected. The meds are just one tool along with counseling and organizational habits that you'll have to develop to learn to work with your ADHD.     In really simple terms, ADHD is an overloading of the prefrontal cortex.  This part of your brain is essentially responsible for directing traffic in your brain, it regulates thoughts and impulses and prioritizes things for your attention. The excess of inputs to the prefrontal cortex means it has troubles filtering stuff out, it struggles to not focus on the largest stimulus it's getting at any moment.  The way a doctor described it to me as a kid has always helped:  A caveman is walking through the woods, and he's getting a constant stream of stimuli coming in from his environment.  He's looking at the trees, watching out for predators, planning his route, etc.  All these inputs are competing for a limited amount of attention in the caveman's brain.  Since the prefrontal cortex is having troubles filtering out what is important from what isn't, the little voice in the back of the caveman's head saying, \"Hey! You forgot your spear!\" gets lost in the noise.  The stimulant medication helps to boost the ability of the prefrontal cortex to deal with all its inputs, which is why they help with focus and impulse regulation.  It's also probably why they are always a bit of a double-edged sword, and taking them does require a conscious effort (often with help from professionals) to maximize their efficacy while minimizing their side effects.  Towards the end of my time taking Adderall I found it really hard to actually focus on the thing I needed to.  I would take my meds and then manically clean my apartment instead of writing the college paper I was supposed to be working on.     A non-ADHD brain would still probably have similar outcomes if they took these meds.  Their focus would be boosted and they'd probably be a bit jittery.

It goes from the relatively small volume of the balloon to the relatively large volume of whatever room you're in. When a gas expands it also cools and that cooling also transfers to the balloon.  The reason gas cools upon expansion is because with a larger volume there are less \"things\" for the molecules to run in to. In this case the things are either the walls of the balloon or the walls of whatever room you're in. With less things to run into, the molecules bounce around less, they lose kinetic energy, and they slow down.  If you didn't know this already, temperature is just a measurement of the average speed of molecules within a substance. So if all the molecules slow down, the temperature goes down.  In short, it's a basic law of thermodynamics. An expanding gas will decrease in temperature (in most scenarios). Vice versa is also true. Compressing a gas will increase it's temperature.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do all equalities require two different things?",
    "answer": "Equality is a bit... wonky in mathematics.  To try to explain a bit from my a bit limited perspective, usually math starts from some world. This world has rules, and it has objects.  Say, integers with addition are an example of a world like this. There are rules(how to sum), and objects(integers). Equality simply tests if the two objects are the same object, and nothing else. Two objects are the same object, they equal. It's really simple.  Why this can get more complicated is often because we often have multiple worlds, and we moving between them. Say, you do math in a world where numbers are like integers, but you always take remainder when divided by two, leaving you with just 0 or 1.  Now, this world has only 2 elements, 0 and 1. Again, 1 is equal to 1 and not to 0, and vice versa. But if you start with integers, and take remainder when divided by 2, you entered this new world from the world of integers. So here, in this new world, integers 5 and 3 are transformed into the same object.  5 mod 2 = 3 mod 2  The problem is, in maths, you often jump in from world to world without noticing the change, so I'm not sure how much this helps. Big part of learning maths is about slowing down enough to appreciate when you are world-hopping, and appreciating the differences in those worlds. But even good or great mathematicians are notoriously sloppy, so... good luck.  But, equality means the things are the exact, precise same thing. Where it gets interesting is when you start trying to figure out what world that thing lives in.",

If you roll two dice certain outcomes are more common, but that doesn't mean you won't ever see double sixes show up some of the time.  So even in the worst case (a breeding pair and their 4 children) inbreeding is likely, but may not be bad enough to prevent successful continuation of the species.  This is especially true of invasive species.  Sometimes these species fit will into an underutilized niche that lets them thrive, even if other factors (like genetic susceptibility) are present.",

    "question": "ELI5: How do electrons have mass if they have no volume? If they have no volume, do they even exist?",
    "answer": "There's no physical law that says that something has to have volume to have mass. It may seem unintuitive because you're used to massive objects taking up space, but really mass and volume are independent things.  And yes, electrons exist. If they didn't exist, then the world as we know it wouldn't exist, electricity wouldn't work, and so on.  If it makes it easier for you, electrons do occupy space in a sort of different way than having volume. Electrons are themselves waves. They act like a smeared out cloud of probability, and that probability wave is in a certain amount of space. We also can't cram an infinite of electrons into a single spot because of something called the Pauli Exclusion Principle. We can only ever have 2 electrons really sharing the same physical space. So even though they don't have volume themselves, they still take up space in a way that's similar to how things that do have volume take up space.",

I am not an expert, and I have never done a study or done this in a technical or clinical setting, so while I have a lot of experience, it is all ultimately a very small data set with my own bias as a filter.  I have read some of the professional literature out there and try to be ethical when practicing as a hobbyist.  That said, hypnosis is quite expansive in terms of what can \"be done\".  The jargon is that it's a highly suggestible state of altered consciousness.  Basically you are more likely to agree to doing something.  Emphasis on more likely.  This isn't MK Ultra sleeper-cell shit.  But, you can get people to believe, feel, do, and experience some extremely crazy things, if they are willing to go along with it.  You can get people to feel or see their bodies change shape, you can get people to believe their own name is something entirely different, you can get people to drop habits (eating chocolate, stopping smoking), you can get people to clean their house without bitching the entire time.  The difficulty usually comes down to specificity and how core the change is to the person.  Getting a person to hurt themself or another person?  Basically impossible, unless it is in a specific context like BDSM.  Getting a person to need to eat at exactly 12:35 p.m. every day is difficult, and relies on a lot of external factors and would require \"programming\" in certain triggers or stops or notifications for the individual.  If there are more questions or clarifications, I'd be open to addressing them.",

    "question": "ELI5 - As a virus mutates to get more contagious why would it usually lose other functions and possibly become less deadly to the host?",
    "answer": "No. And I'm honestly sick of people spreading this narrative because they read it in an article or on another Reddit comment or something. So thank you for asking instead of believing it.  To answer your question: There are *some* diseases where this is known to be true. To curb your enthusiasm, neither the Spanish flu H1N1 nor Sars-CoV-2 are examples of these. There are other reasons why H1N1 suddenly got less pathogenic during the pandemic, and it's the same reason why Sars-CoV-2 gets less pathogenic during this pandemic: the human immune system.  In the example of the Spanish flu which hit an unvaccinated population as the first major Influenza A type virus: The virus killed 50 million people, 1/3 of europe. We can assume that the transmission rate for this disease must've been very high already because of this. Yet the lethality didn't prevent the disease from infecting nearly all of europe and killing 1/3 of it. Why did it became less lethal them?   Because it already infected basically everyone. And therefore basically everyone had build up an immune response for the infection, and in case of a re-infection, they were less likely to spread the virus or develop a severe disease. That was what killed the pandemic, not some less lethal mutated strain that some Redditors want you to believe.  And this is most likely what will happen to Sars-CoV-2 as well: The vaccinated and the already infected population will continue to grow, therefore the virus will have a harder time to spread or to develop a severe form of Covid-19.   Will there be a seasonal outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 like with the flu? Probably not. The mutation rate of Sars-CoV-2 is a lot lower than that of Influenza A type viruses.  Will you need a yearly shot for the vaccine then? Also probably not. It may be that immunocompromised persons, as well as persons who travel to an area of risk may need a refresh of the vaccine, but that should be about it. There are countless examples of vaccines that need 2-3 boosters before your immunised, like Rabies, Polio, Tetanus, Hepatitis A and B or Typhus.  Is the theory true at all? Yes, for some viruses. But it is absolutely impossible to proof it for Sars-CoV-2 or any Influenza A type virus simply because the immune response is such a huge factor for this. There are also many examples of a virus that didn't mutate to a higher transmission rate without losing their pathogenicity. Examples for those would be MERS, SARS-COV-1, Rabies, Hepatitis A and B, Polio or Smallpox.",
    "follow-up": "To correct some previous comments here: No, the selection pressure also doesn't lay on low lethality. The selection pressure lays on a high transmission rate.  What does that mean? The virus infects you and, assuming your only develop mild symptoms, stays for about 2 weeks. After these two weeks the virus will be defeated by your immune system and you can't spread anymore  Assuming you develop severe symptoms, the virus will likely stay longer than two weeks but, if you're not dying, your immune system will defeat the virus again and even if you're dying, the virus will still be dead and can't spread anymore.  What does that tell you? Well for one, the virus doesn't care if you die or don't die, because there will be a point where it can't spread anymore. So obviously mutations with a higher transmission rate will be favoured, because those will spread more often until further spread eventually becomes impossible.  The optimum for the virus here would be: Evade the immune system as long as possible, spread more viruses to other individuals. And that's where the selection pressure lays on.  What does evading the immune system mean? Your immune system is one of the most complex things you'll find on this planet and has adapted to a variety of pathogens. For a variety this large your immune system needs to have a lot of communication between your body cells, infected cells and immune cells. And this communication is often interupted by a virus, to disturb the immune response. An infected cell for example normally shows that it is infected. Some viruses however have developed proteines that interfer with this process, so the infected cell has no way of communicating that it actually is infected.  Sorry, this became a bit long. But it's a very complex topic and I've simplified it as gar as I could",

    "answer": "An equalizer is an audio tool that is used to amplify or dampen specific frequencies. The terms we use are boost/cut. An audio track's sound is a combination of many individual frequencies of sound. An equalizer allows to amplify/reduce of specific frequencies only, instead of boosting the volume of an entire track.  Practically, it means we can make a specific aspect of the sound pop out more, or even cut undesirable frequencies.  > \"set\" different tracks in different frequencies so they won't null each other  That's not what an EQ does by definition, but it is what an EQ can be used for. Tracks don't \"null\" each other simply by containing repeated audio frequencies. However, having too many tracks that do overlap in the spectrum makes for a bad crowded mix. So yes, an EQ can be set to isolate tracks to specific regions of the spectrum, depending on the audio that track plays. The simplest example is isolating a low kick drum to the bass/low-range, a guitar to the mid-range, and a hi-hat/cymbal to the hi-range.",

The issue with fungus most people don't realise is that it's very hard to kill fungus without doing harm to you.

    "answer": "It didn't, or at least you're not going to find many economists who agree that it did.  Pay and productivity didn't begin diverging until 1984 - 13 years after the Nixon Shock.  The overwhelming consensus as to the cause of the Productivity-Pay gap is that in 1983 the US re-designated China as a \"friendly\" nation.  This both allowed for the export of advanced US manufacturing technology to China and significantly reduced US trade barriers to imported Chinese goods.    Following that change, US workers began having to compete against Chinese workers, who were working under a system in which the government fixed their wages to be the equivalent of ~$350 per year, with workers in small, private Chinese factories often earning less than that.  The world before 1990 was a much different place than it is now.  Outside of the US and Europe infrastructure was generally non-existent, governments were wildly corrupt, and guerilla movements were widespread.  China was one of the only third world countries with a functional government, well developed infrastructure, and no ongoing guerilla war within its borders.  What prevented it from developing was its international isolation - the West didn't recognize it and the Soviet Union was openly hostile towards it.  China was able to rapidly develop once the US opened up to it.  This injected a billion ultra-low wage Chinese workers into the international economy who were roughly as productive and competent as those in the West.  If you're an unskilled laborer in the West then you're competing for jobs based on the wage you want to be paid.    After China opened up, you suddenly found yourself competing against ~5 times as many laborers for the same number of jobs as you were before, which exerts an extremely strong downward pressure on wages.  This downward pressure has gotten even worse as you get closer to the present and more third world countries have been able to develop their governments and infrastructure to the point that they're able to participate in the global economy.",

Does a calorie represent the amount of work accomplished outside your body (like, travelling 1K), or the amount of internal work (travelling 1K easily or having to work hard)?  If a pro athlete runs 1K and an average guy runs 1K, did they both burn the same number of calories?",

But I'll answer yours as it contains a variation on the original.  > If a pro athlete runs 1K and an average guy runs 1K, did they both burn the same number of calories?  Different. Assuming everything is basically the same, the pro athlete does what to his body is a light jog around the course, keeping time exactly with a couch potato doing for what his body is an intense run along the same course, their bodies are doing different things.  The athlete's body is highly efficient motion requiring less work, their heart rate stays low, breathing stays low, carbon dioxide production (from the actual chemical reactions that produce energy) stays low. The couch potato's body is doing the opposite, all those are much higher.  Not only do they burn more in running across the field, they also burn more while their body is trying to recover from the run.  /Edit / followup: The reason for asking this type of thing is often about weight loss, which doesn't directly relate. The calorie difference is minor for weight change. Far more critical to the body's fat content is the types of food eaten, the amount of food eaten, and the timing of food eaten.  For those looking at body fat, a person eating a meal that quickly floods the body with energy (starches like potatoes or corn, processed grains like bread, raw sugars like juice or processed sugar) the body will naturally flood with insulin to store the energy in fat. Similarly eating a big dinner the body is digesting the food flooding the body with energy right when it needs to sleep, and the energy needs to go somewhere so the body floods with insulin to store it as fat. The body doesn't like releasing fat, and the intensity of exercise makes a big difference to if the liver will switch gears into sticking with the short-term reserves versus releasing some from fat. Many people engage in quick exercise regimes that don't trigger releasing from fat reserves, and also eat food providing their body with lots of energy (e.g. \"energy bars\" and \"energy drinks\") and unwittingly trigger their body to store even more fat, despite also burning calories.  It is absolutely possible to both be burning more calories and also storing more fat.",

They would rather have you upgrade your computer. For similar types of server hardware that can support multiple protocols you often have to pay additional license fees to get these upgrades.  There may still be some technical limitations here. Even though USB4 is based on Thunderbolt 3 there are some slight differences in the way it communicates and the reserved channels. So it is possible that the chip is so optimized for Thunderbolt 3 that it can not technically be upgraded to USB4.

It\u2019s like insomnia, if you find a way to stop thinking about sleep it comes - if you stop thinking about breathing or blinking, they come",
    "follow-up": "Adding more detail, you have 3 general types of muscular tissue histologically: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle.   Skeletal muscle is consciously controlled, your arms moving, kicking a ball, eating a slice of pizza at 3 am in front of the refrigerator.   Smooth muscle is not voluntarily controlled, so after stuffing yourself with that pizza at really unreasonable hours, you don't have to actively control the muscles in your digestive system - can you imagine the horror it would be if you had to remember to contract your GI tract? Instead, it's made up of smooth muscle tissue that is controlled independently from your consciousness.  Which leads us to the original question: your eyelids and your diaphragm (for breathing) are skeletal muscle, they are consciously controlled - there are many situations in which you should have autonomous control over those muscles, facial expressions are crucial for communication, you can manipulate how light enters your eyes, preemptively avoid a threat, you can purposely breathe harder or softer, be loud or quiet, control and modulate your speech, and so on.   But as you might have guessed forgetting to breathe would be a very bad idea, and so would be forgetting to blink and losing your eyes, so as a result of evolutionary pressure animals very quickly (in fact, simultaneously with the appearance of those structures) developed groups of neurons that can take over as soon as you stop activating those muscles consciously.

Measuring how two things vary with each other is much easier--as one variable goes up, what happens to the other?   Holding one constant means you ensure it doesn't vary. So, in your example, you pick a sample where everyone is roughly the same age. That way any differences in weight will be solely due to height.  You hold the variable you're not interested in constant, so you know that whatever results you see aren't caused by that.

    "answer": "Could be bologna but I\u2019ve seen a \u201csovereign citizen\u201d video where they refuse to stand as the magistrates enter, and it appeared to create a stalemate in which the proceedings could not\u2026. proceed. In my vague attempt to understand their strategy, the implication of obeying these orders (\u201call rise\u2026\u201d) is akin to to acknowledging the judges  jurisdiction over the proceedings, and that this acknowledgement or agreement is actually in fact necessary for them to proceed. So continuing to fall down the sovereign citizen rabbit hole, it appears that the \u201csocial pressure to show respect\u201d is actually a form of \u201ctrickery\u201d or \u201csubtle coercion\u201d through which they get you to formally agree to the legal construct within which they want to proceed.",

    "answer": "There are two main parts to a web browser: the \"browser engine\", and \"everything else\".  A browser engine is responsible for taking the website data that gets downloaded to your computer and turning it into an actual web page that you can read, click on, interact with, etc. Writing a browser engine is *insanely* complicated, to the point where some quite smart programmers consider \"writing a new engine from scratch\" to be basically impossible. There are pretty much only 3 browser engines in use: Gecko - which powers Firefox, WebKit - which powers Safari and other iOS browsers - and Blink - which powers Chrome, Edge, and a whole bunch of others.  In comparison, \"everything else\" is pretty easy. This is stuff like: make a program that your computer can show on-screen, save and load a user's bookmarks, show them a search bar that can search multiple sites, etc. When someone makes a \"new browser\" like Brave, they almost always start with an existing engine, in this case Blink, and write the rest of the program around it.

    "answer": "It depends on the way they freeze!    If you make ice cubes in a tray in your fridge, the cold touches the outer water first. This will freeze first. As water gets colder, it can hold less gas - some of the air in the water will form bubbles. Freezing outside in, these bubbles get trapped in the ice, making it cloudy.    By comparison, an industrial ice cube maker usually uses cold 'fingers' around which water flows, meaning that the ice cubes freeze from the inside out - any air that would get trapped, gets carried away with the flow of water, leaving a nice and transparent cube of ice. This is where restaurant ice gets those holes in it, too.    Edit: I've done some more research and found out that while the above does hold true, the impurities, minerals and such, in water also play a big part. As ice freezes, it crystallises, and the crystal structures tend to push those impurities out. Freeze outside in, they get pushed towards and bunch up in the middle - freeze inside out, and they escape with the flowing water.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does it work with musicians selling their catalogs, their publishing rights, their songs, their songwriting, their recording rights, etc.?",
    "answer": "There's two different concepts at play here; **copyright** and **distribution rights**.  And there's more than one type of each one.  **Copyright** is the most-basic form of \"ownership\" of creative works.  If you sing and record a song, you own the copyright on that recording, and no one else may make a copy.  If they do, you can sue them.  It is possible to sell the copyright to someone else.  If I'm a record label, I *could* buy the copyright to your song and put it on an album.  But this is very rarely done, because then it would no longer be \"your\" song.  You wouldn't be able to record a new version since I now own the copyright.  So it's far more common to grant **distribution rights**.  This is a contract between the musician and the publisher which says \"The publisher is allowed to publish this song and sell it to others.  They will receive X% of the profits and the artist will receive Y%.\"  This is how almost all music distribution works.  Contracts typically spell out forms of distribution (e.g. physical media, mp3 downloads, streaming platforms).  Just because you grant me the right to print CDs with your song on it, that does not give me the right to stream your song on my website.  There is more than one type of copyright at work in music, too.  There is the copyright on the *composition* and the copyright on the *performance*.  I could write a song - write the music and lyrics - and then you could perform and record it, and there would be two separate copyrights.  Publishers would have to get rights from both of us to publish the music.  Generally, the composer of a piece of music and the performer get paid differently.  This is a complex subject but composers get *mechanicals* (a fixed sum every time the song is reproduced or broadcast).  Performers do not receive these.  A session musician (someone who did not write the song but was hired to play for a recording) will not receive money besides what they are paid for the day's work.  So, bullet points:  * When an artist sells the rights to their music, they still *own* the copyright.  They have just given someone else permission to publish the music. * The composer of a song continues to make money in royalties every time the song is reproduced or broadcast.  In the example of Springsteen, since he is the composer and the performer he will receive these, even if he *also* earned a big lump sum for selling the rights. * Selling the rights to a set of songs does *not* imply that you are selling the rights to all future songs.  Sometimes artists enter into a contract with publishers which *does* explicitly state that the publisher will hold all rights to a set number of future recordings, but this is not the case with Springsteen. * Since artists retain copyright on their works, they can perform their own music without paying for it, even after selling rights to a publisher.  It is possible that a contract would explicitly forbid the artist from performing their works, but that wouldn't benefit anybody. * Since Springsteen is the composer, he will receive royalties when others perform his music. * Selling the distribution rights to a recording does not forbid you from making a new recording of the same song.  You retain the copyright on the composition and thus can do anything you like so long as it is not in violation of a contract you have signed.",

    "answer": "The ancient Babylonians loved the numbers 12, 60, and 360, as still used to measure time, angles, and geographic coordinates. They looked at the apparent path of the Sun, Moon, and planets across the stars and divided that belt into twelve starry constellations that filled equal arcs, 30 degrees each. They used those 12 constellations to measure the apparent positions of Solar System objects. So it had a legitimate astronomical purpose.  The Greeks and Romans took this Babylonian system and used it for divination. In particular, Ptolemy of Alexandria (100-170) wrote several books that mingled astronomy and astrology and remained influential for about 1500 years, until the advent of modern astronomy separated the field from astrology.  Modern astronomy began with Tycho Brahe, a Danish astronomer and astrologer who persuaded King Frederick II of Denmark to grant him an isolated island and funding to build large astronomical instruments and take many careful measurements, all with the naked eye. He was the first astronomer to significantly improve upon the Ptolemaic model of the universe.  Brahe\u2019s careful observations were used by Johannes Kepler to develop the laws of planetary motion, and Kepler\u2019s calculations in turn provided the foundation for Newton's theory of universal gravitation.

    "question": "ELI5: What happens with the potential energy when a person walk downstairs?",
    "answer": "This are very good questions that highlight the nuances between the uses of \"work\" and \"energy\" in physics.   Taking your example of a car slowing down, \"negative work\" is done on the car to get it to stop moving. The car has lost kinetic energy, and where did it go, since energy is always conserved? It might make more sense to say that the car was doing work on the person (causing them to move back), and so the person is absorbing energy from the car. So while the car lost energy, that lost energy was gained by the person pushing against it and energy is conserved.   When we say that energy is conserved, we must be careful to include everything in our calculation. It seemed like energy was lost when the car slowed down, but that is because we forgot to account for the energy the car passed onto the person slowing it down.   In the staircase example, you see that the potential energy is different between the top and bottom of the stairs and say that people should gain energy going downstairs. But, this ignores how that person got downstairs. They start at the top (zero kinetic energy), their muscles accelerate to bring their foot to the next step, and then decelerate to plant the foot on the step, and this process repeats the length of the staircase. Thinking about it this way, there is clearly energy that must be used to traverse each step. The energy expended to take each step is much larger than what can be gained from the change in potential energy from going downstairs, so we always lose energy. However you are still right, because it is easier to go downstairs (moving with gravity) than it is to go upstairs (moving against gravity).  In beginner (high-school / early college) physics, typically we ignore the process it takes to get from one potential energy level to another, and this is good for a macro-scale picture. Forces like gravity are called [\"conservative forces\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force) because energy is naturally conserved if that's all you consider. In higher-level courses, like thermodynamics, then we care about how someone got from point A to point B. Did they take one step at a time? Did they skip multiple? These questions answer how much energy is lost due to going down the steps. Because energy is lost, we call these non-conservative forces, a good example being friction where the energy is lost as heat. Tying back to energy conservation, we can consider that the person at the top of the steps has stored chemical energy from the foods that they ate in addition to this potential energy. That chemical energy is converted to mechanical (taking steps) then to heat (due to friction and inefficiencies). This energy conversion is really separate from the potential energy that you are considering in your post.",

If you take that water and split it between multiple cups, if the water from one is emptied or another filled up with more there is less of a drastic effect on the overall amount.  An etf is like spreading your investments rather than putting everything into a single stock. You may not feel as much of a benefit if one stock in the etf starts increasing in price, but equally there would be less of an effect if another stock falls.  There are all sorts of etfs that track stocks in different industries too, for example the etf QQQ is a combination of multiple tech stocks, there are other etfs that track battery tech companies, healthcare companies, finance companies etc.  As an example, taking the Q\u2019s the current top 5 holdings and the percentage of the ETF they take up out of 103 stocks are: Apple 11.71%, Microsoft 10.71%, Amazon 7.53%, Tesla 5.82%, Nvidia 5.29%",

If you look at the specifications of any storage device, you will see a note that says something along the lines of \u201d1 GB = 1 billion bytes. Actual usable capacity may vary.\u201d In other words, the drive capacity is reported on the assumption that 1GB is 1,000,000,000 bytes. A 480GB SSD is, in other words, actually 480,000,000,000 bytes; these are what we call decimal bytes, and it has been an industry standard to use them when advertising storage space.  A Unix\u00ae based operating system like macOS X\u00ae or Linux\u00ae uses decimal bytes when reporting storage space, so a 480GB SSD will show up as 480GB in Mac Disk Utility for instance. The Windows\u00ae OS on the other hand uses binary bytes, so 1,024 bytes per Kilobyte, 1,024 KB per Megabyte, and so on. This means that when you install a 480,000,000,000 bytes storage drive into a Windows\u00ae computer, that computer converts the number of bytes into gigabytes by dividing by 1024 all the way up through the scale, not by dividing by 1,000.

    "answer": "So, let's discuss *alternating current.*  First, we need to determine what exactly is alternating to give it its name. What's alternating is the *voltage,* which is a measurement of electrical \"pressure\" -- how hard the power source wants to push electrons through a circuit.  What does it *mean* for the voltage to alternate? Well, mains voltage (what's in your walls) is 120V, 60Hz. This means that sixty times per second, the voltage sweeps from +120V through 0V to -120V and back. This looks like a nice sine wave when you plot it.  OK, fine. voltage is alternating. But what does that *actually mean?* Take a look at [this simplified diagram](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/a/0/7/b/a/522783e0757b7fc2168b4567.gif); in it, the rotating wheel **alternately** pushes and pulls a piston. You'll notice that the water is pushed first one way, then the other as the rotation of the wheel is turned into a back-and-forth motion.  This is, in fact, exactly what happens in (most) power generation stations across the planet. Electricity is mostly generated by a spinning turbine, which spins a generator. If you rotate a magnet in a coil of wire, you generate an electric current; since the magnet is rotating, the electric current goes one way for half the rotation, and the other way for the other half. That sounds a lot like **alternation**, doesn't it?  This is exactly how AC current is generated at the power station and then sent to your home.",

    "question": "ELI5 Why is moving money from one bank account to another is much faster when using a card than a usual transfer?",
    "answer": "The banking system in the US is based around two principles:  - (a) Transactions are processed in a batch at the end of a day, excluding Sundays and holidays. - (b) Mistakes can be made, but they can be fixed by calling the other bank involved in a timely manner.  Rule (a) means that you're going to wait up to 24 hours, because your orders to transfer money don't actually take effect until 4pm (or whenever the cutoff time is).  So if you do your transaction before 4pm, you're waiting until 4pm; if you do it after, you're waiting until 4pm the next day.  Rule (b) means there's usually a several-day wait because if your bank \"sees\" you got sent $1000 from XYZ bank, they're really worried that you might ask for $1000 in cash and disappear, then get a call from XYZ bank the next day saying \"Yeah that $1000 was totally a mistake!  /u/sedulas shouldn't have that money!\"  Now your bank has to try to track you down and sue you to get the money back, they might not be able to find you or recover the money.  The solution is, until enough time has elapsed that they're confident they won't get that call from XYZ bank, the money either won't show at all in your account, or show as \"uncleared\" (it's there but you can't use it yet).  The system works this way because its rules were designed back in the days when everybody kept track of transactions by hand on paper.  When you work that way, you could have problems if customers are transacting while the clerks were updating their files.  So the lobby of the bank would close at 4pm.  Then the clerks would all go to the back to organize all the day's transactions and updated everybody's balances, with no interference from incoming transactions.  Of course just about everybody uses computers instead now, but when they started putting the computers in, they were all programmed to use the same rules as the paper-based system.  After all, if your bank's the first one to implement a computer-based system, it still has to do business with everybody else who uses the paper system.  Now it's inertia and decentralization.  If the banks change the rules, they would all have to change at once.  Changing the basic rules of the financial system sounds risky and expensive, something done for convenience of consumers with no direct profit.  \"Risky, expensive, and no direct profit\" is the sort of business activity bankers reflexively try to avoid.",

    "answer": "So this is really complicated but I'll do my best.   Everything in the universe with mass is effected by gravity, every single atom, even light. The more mass you have, the larger your attractive force to any other massive object. But it can be counter intuitive to think of orbiting as just one object pulling on another because it has velocity as well and everything pulls on everything else everywhere, just with diminishing effects over distance. Pluto right now is pulling slightly on your body in its direction veeeeeerrry slightly, and also the sun, and the moon, and the Andromeda Galaxy. Also orbiting is just a balance between how fast you're going and how much gravity is pulling on you. That's why we need to go so fast leaving the planet, if you didn't you'd just come right back down.  BUT these bad boys are a tad different, they are the most extreme gravitational objects in the universe and they're orbiting eachother at significant fractions of the speed of light. So each revolution one makes around the other one, they both pull on eachother but they keep missing because they're both going so fast. But they're getting closer because of the \"friction\" between them is slowing them down. This leaves a gravitational \"wake\" behind each of them because gravititational waves move at the speed of light and then radiate outwards. So this creates wobbles in space like ripples in a pond. Imagine you were spinning in a circle in a pool and scooping out water with your hand while you spin, this creates a cavity(low part of wave) that then gets filled in by the surrounding water (high point of wave when it splashes back). But the magnitude of these waves were so significant that we could detect them despite this event taking place eons ago at distances you can't even comprehend. So it didn't exactly shake it, more of a very significant wobble. It's like ringing the bell of the universe and we found a way to hear the sound",

So you say each one of our dollars can be redeemed for a US dollar whenever you want and we have those dollars stored ready for you to redeem. Now people don't have to trust that your dollars will be useful. If they are not, they can trade them for something that is at a fixed rate.   That is a fixed currency. When people don't trust that they will be able to use their money to actually buy things, countries fix those currency to something that has a more accepted value. US Dollars, Euros, gold, silver, etc.   But there is a problem here. Let's say you have handed out all your money, but need more to pay your bills. You can't just make more unless you also acquire some more US dollars. But if you had those, you wouldn't need to print more money. You can reduce the rate people can exchange your money for, but you can only do that for so long and the result is almost always massive inflation. So once that fails you really have no other option than say that your money is no longer going to be fixed to the dollar.   Your money will now \"float\" in that it's value will be determined by what people are willing to pay for it instead of the value of something else. This allows you to make as much of it as you want. This works fine in a Country like the US where everyone accepts dollars and they can easily be used both domestically and internationally. But if your country does not have a good economy, or your government is bad at managing money policy, then that is not true.   How this works is hard to ELI5, but being able to control the issuance of money allows you to control interest rates. By raising those, you can make present money more valuable and that can reduce inflation. The US effectively did this in the 80s at the cost of a rather severe, but short lived, recession.   Whether it will work in Sri Lanka or not is not something I can answer since I am not familiar with the situation. But if the same incompetent and corrupt people are still in charge I'd doubt it.",

    "answer": "It's called the \"Pareto Principle\" more formally, and it's based observations made by an Italian Economist back in the early 1900's. Pareto's initial point was that wealth was imbalanced in Italy at the time, roughly 20% of households held 80% of wealth.  More broadly, the Pareto Principle is the observation that sometimes small groups of things (or \"inputs\") have oversized effects (\"outputs\").  People in business programs are taught how to apply \"Pareto Analysis\" to seek insights into how their business functions.  Some examples -  How does our revenue reflect our individual sales? Maybe a small number of transactions account for the majority of our revenue. From this we might focus advertising or deal brokering on those transactions.  How do our clients reflect our sales? Maybe only one or two clients out of hundreds are our big sales, we should focus our customer service efforts on maintaining or growing them, vs. the people who just a single doodad each week.  How do our products represent sales? Maybe I sell 10 different doodads, 9 of them just sit on the shelves collecting dust and 1 I sell by the dozens each day. I should focus procurement and inventory on the one that sells out daily and only keep a small number of the other 9 in stock.  I'll just say, it's not a firm rule, like there is no physics or something underlying why 80/20 keeps popping up. It's just an analytical concept that helps people step back and understand, using real numbers and data, how things work and how best to manage or change a system.",

    "question": "ELI5: How high can a superfluid climb?",
    "answer": "Provided you have enough superfluid to coat the entire container, it would climb arbitrarily high, forever. There's no really intuitive way to explain it, but in the simplest terms possible, when a fluid is attracted more strongly to a container than it is its own particles, the fluid will creep up the side of the container. This attraction is to do with electromagnetism, and is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum forces.     You know how water on a totally flat surface will pool, but when it finds a corner or a wall, it immediately sticks to it? This is the same kind of attraction between the particles of the wall and the fluid at work. In a container, the little curve the upper surface of fluid will make is called a [meniscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_%28liquid%29). When the fluid is strongly attracted to itself, it bulges outwards. When it's more strongly attractive to the container wall, it curves upwards.   This meniscus is limited by the viscosity of a fluid, viscosity itself being a measure of internal frictional forces of the fluid. But when the fluid has *no* viscosity at all, we get interesting effects. There is *zero* internal friction in the fluid, it has *zero* internal attraction, it has *no* limit on how far that little meniscus can creep upwards. The limiting factors of how far upwards the liquid can climb up the side of the container have been completely removed. So, it climbs indefinitely.   Why does this force overpower gravity? Well, remember, this force is an electromagnetic one between the wall and the fluid. This is significant, because electromagnetic forces are 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times stronger than gravitational forces. That's not an exaggeration, that is the actual number. 10^36. That's a thousand quadrillion times more than the number of grains of sand on Earth. Case in point: a bog-standard scrapyard electromagnet can lift up a several ton car with ease, overpowering the gravitational force that an *entire planet* can muster. When electromagnetic forces are involved, gravity might as well not even exist.",

    "question": "eli5 why does gold have such an extraordinarily high elctronegativity?",
    "answer": "This is sort of a complicated question because it requires an understanding of electron structures.  Typically as elements get heavier, the electrons fill into \u201cshells\u201d around the nucleus  The 1s orbital can hold 2  The 2s orbital can hold 2  The 2p orbital can hold 6  Elements as heavy as gold have layer upon layer of s (2), p (6), d (10), and f (14) shells filled in from the bottom.  The lowest electrons are closest to the nucleus and feel an enormous charge from the protons there - they\u2019re almost impossible to remove.  The highest electrons are \u201cshielded\u201d by all those beneath them and only feel a weak charge.  They\u2019re easier to remove.  The more shielded the highest levels are, the lower the electronegativity.  So what about gold?  Gold is just one electron away from completing a d orbital, and pairing up all your electrons in complete orbitals is an atom\u2019s happy place for various quantum mechanical reasons.  Rather than wait around for a generous donor, gold looks inward and pulls an electron out from a lower orbital to fill the d shell.  With a filled and highly stable d shell and an unshielded vacancy below it, you end up with a metal that would rather fill the vacancy like an electronegative oxidizer instead of giving up another electron and destabilizing the filled d shell.  This gives it an abnormally high electronegativity for a transition metal.  Oddball d-shell structures are fairly typical for transition metals, and so their chemistry is much harder to predict than the elements closer to the edge of the table.",

    "answer": "The fact that I'm about to give a possibly-controversial answer to this question means it may violate Rule 5 or 6, but I'll at least provide data to support my answer.  The sustainability of water usage is a *local* concern -- it's really only a serious issue in certain parts of the world.    The US as a whole uses [224 cubic km](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir1405) of water per year for domestic use, agriculture, and industrial activities.  By \"use\" I mean removal from rivers, lakes, or groundwater.  I'm discounting power plant use, for reasons I'll explain below.  That's about 681 m^3 per person per year, or about 1.8 m^3 per person per day.  That's a hell of a lot of water, but the discharge of the Mississippi River watershed *alone* is about [730 cubic km/year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River).  When you add in all the other rivers in the contiguous US (the top 10 add up to 1400 km^3 /year), you can see we're using a very small fraction of the available water -- less than 15%.  And the US is a fairly dry country: I haven't worked the numbers for Europe, but I bet it's even less of a problem there.  Why did I ignore thermoelectric power plant usage?  It amounts to about *half* of all freshwater withdrawals in the US.  But power plants don't eat water: they take it from a river or lake, use it to cool the steam in their turbines, and then return it, same water, just slightly warmer than it was.  This warming does have some [environmental consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_pollution), but they're local and don't prevent the water from being used for other purposes.  And that leads to a really big issue: you can't talk about water \"consumption\" the way you do with fossil fuels.  Water isn't destroyed by use, its properties are changed.  Power plant effluent is still fine for drinking.  Water used by agriculture evaporates, and will fall as rain somewhere else. Properly treated sewage is still fine for power plant, industrial, or agricultural use.  The same drop of water can be used by dozens of human activities on its way to the sea.  Because of water re-use, my comparison of US human water usage to river outflow above is *wildly conservative*.  Finally, some stats on the amount of energy needed to process, treat, pump, and store all this water.  Drinking and wastewater treatment systems amount to about [2%](https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-water-infrastructure/energy-efficiency-water-utilities) of all energy consumed in the US.  Once again that's not negligible, but it's pretty small potatoes compared to vehicles, indoor heating and cooling, and electricity consumption.  The point is that water consumption is large, has environmental consequences, and has plenty of room for improvement, but for the US as a whole, it's nowhere near as big a concern as, for example, fossil fuel use.  People concerned about water usage do their cause no favors by talking about water being \"consumed\" the same way fossil fuels are used: we must think about how the water been *changed* by human activity, and what the consequences of each type of use are.  Why does global environmentalism focus so much on water?  Here, I'm giving my opinion.  Much of the modern environmental movement grew out of California: they drove much of the progress in air pollution and fuel efficiency standards in the 1970s and 1980s, and in that state, water conservation is a huge issue.  As other regions followed California's lead, they kept its intense focus on water.",
    "follow-up": "Your stats don't appear to be wrong, but I think your interpretation of them is off.  First, the comparison to \"available water\" is problematic. You're implicitly assuming that all of that water - or even a large part of it - is \"freely\" available without significant environmental consequences. Is that true? It's possible that we can divert 90% of a river's output without major consequences - but it's also possible that diverting more than 5% will have major consequences.  Second, and perhaps more importantly: you're underestimating the significance of \"small\" changes. 2% of energy, for example, isn't small potatoes - it's a huge amount. One of the greatest challenges of ecological policy is that *virtually everything* is a matter of accumulated tiny changes. It is impossible to make any single change that improves the state of things by 50%, or 30%, or even 10% - instead, it is a long effort to get up to the total needed by increments of a half-percent, or a tenth of a percent, at a time.  That's why environmentalism has to \"focus\" on so many different things at once - because they all need to be done at once. This is not generally a natural or intuitive way of thinking for humans, unfortunately.",

    "answer": "Ooo oo! Geodesist here! Everything everyone says here is true. All the beautiful trig, chefs kiss. This is the foundation of geodesy on a global scale. As you can imagine, takes a lot of time and energy to make these lines and do it well! The conceptualization noted above about \u2018imagine things are all flat to start\u2019 is how we think of terrestrial based surveying. We put thousands of  metal benchmarks in the ground, over decades, to measure between. But once you want to keep going, your network covers countries, and eventually continents! Now it becomes harder to ignore that the earth is indeed curved. Changes the math just a bit, but still, we were able to do an impressive job over the last 100yrs! Another comment noted radar topography. Absolutely. At different scales, different radar technologies are used flood an environment (from the ground, from a plane etc) with ranging signals (basically radar), and can then build a \u2018surface model\u2019 of whatever was targeted. This can be done at very small scale (a statue from the ground) or very large (100km mountain  range with airborne LiDAR). This doesn\u2019t tell us how high a mountain is, but only it\u2019s shape. Where it is on the planet is not part of the question until you involve reference to absolute space. AKA position or coordinates. This lets us talk about elevation above something common to everywhere; sea level! But where is sea level? Is it the same in all oceans? Over time day as tides move? It\u2019s complicated. In more recent decades, we\u2019ve moved on to a new way. We use a pair of satellites that measure gravity under them as they pass over the planet. Gravity is proportional to mass, so areas of the surface with more mass (ex mountains) have a stronger pull on the sats as they pass. We then use this as a proxy for elevation. Now instead of networks of lines and points fixed on the ground, to which you need to draw more lines from to find out the height of a new mountain for example, we have a grid. A raster. A giant pixel or cell based grid with an elevation in each square. We ground truth this \u2018gravimetric model\u2019 with permanent gnss instruments (gps) scattered over the land, to kind of check that the elevations we take from the gravity model, are the same as what positioning constellations see. Then we also take measurements of gravity at several places on the surface too using a giant gravimeter machine that we tote around across the continent to highly controlled bunker type buildings.  After alllll that, we can then use a geodetic grade gnss (gps) instrument to take a measurement anywhere on the continent, and know that it\u2019s repeatable and reliable, and relative to an unchanging reference; gravity. Except that the planet actually is changing shape all the time\u2026..that makes all the above even more difficult.  But we simply make a time series of gravity \u2018snapshots\u2019 over time, and then difference them from the last for example, and have a value in each pixel that says what the gravity is now. Could be more, less, and can be changing at different rates. This x,y is falling 4mm/yr, but that x,y is lifting by only 1mm/yr. So now we have a grid of velocity. In the future, we may find ourselves with near real time surface acceleration. This is exciting for reasons I won\u2019t say, as I\u2019ve gone on much too long already. Talking about my work is something I usually avoid as it is somewhat abstract, but I chose to indulge your invitation!

If the molecules of the two pieces can't stick together the horizontal force component doesn't mean anything .  And then there's actually a van der Waals forces between the molecules of the two surfaces themselves.  For instance we used to think that ice was slippery because it melted slightly under pressure. But it turns out ices inherently slippery even if zero melting occurs. The water molecules that are stuck to the interacting surface eventually have to reach a layer where only one of the two hydrogens can make a bond. So these loose hydrogen bonds basically turn the water molecules into little pinwheels and people fall down.   So there is shape, which is whole together by molecular forces, and then there's the attempt of the two materials to interact with each other kind of like they want to become one in some cases and kind of like they don't want to have anything to do with each other in other cases.  This is important particularly in the difference between static friction and dynamic friction. It's harder to start something moving than it is to keep something moving because the static friction is usually higher than the dynamic friction. This is because the two surfaces have had time to respond to each other fully when the object is stationary. While typically moving object can't reform its boundaries and bonds as thoroughly as the stationary one could.  And that's also kind of why things can become permanently stuck from having long enough to basically grab hold of each other.

Electricity is supplied across a vast and complex network of transmission lines and through various substations. This means that when power is cut to one area \u2013 for example by a tree falling and breaking a power line \u2013 power can be rerouted along another line from another area.  If there enough damaged power lines, then the remaining lines aren't able to safely carry enough electricity to supply everybody, so the utility company has to use measures like rolling blackouts or reduced voltage.",
    "follow-up": "So the pinpointed blackouts are a deliberate calculation to manage power rather than random damaged lines? That would make sense as the areas affected seem to follow no natural pattern.  Our house is down but the shop across the road is fine.",

    "question": "ELI5: What would happen if an object is travelling upwards, but slower than the 2nd cosmic velocity? Say, a rocket launches and reaches a sustainable speed of 2,000 km/h. What would happen?",
    "answer": "2nd cosmic velocity means that if you were traveling at less than that ,going directly up, and if you cut thrust, eventually you would fall back to earth.   Essential to that however is **if you cut thrust**.   If you cut thrust, as you went higher and higher, you would start slowing down, and eventually you fall back to the earth.   You would need to continue applying thrust to maintain that 2,000km/h.  But as you get further and further from the center of the earth, your escape velocity keeps dropping.   Eventually you'd reach a point where your escape velocity was below 2,000km/h and then you could turn off your engine and never fall back down to earth.    So you would enter orbit of the sun.   If you pointed away from the sun and kept going away at 2,000 km/h, relative to the sun, you'd escape that too.  Space craft don't really do this though, there's a complex interaction of various physical laws that lead to something called the Oberth Effect, that basically means that if you burned your fuel really close to the earth it would be more efficient than burning it further away, but that's a whole nother complicated mess.",
    "follow-up": "This is why I mentioned **sustainable** speed of 2k km/h, i.e. the thrust is not cut off :-)   But as you get further and further from the center of the earth, your escape velocity keeps dropping. - I think this was the piece that was missing for my better understanding - thanks!   So theoretically, I could be travelling at a walking speed of 5 km/h and, as long as I don't cut my thrust, I would escape the Earth's gravity.   Follow-up question: why do rockets go through the trouble of reaching crazy speeds to escape the Earth's gravity? Is it more efficient?

    "question": "ELI5: What would happen if an object is travelling upwards, but slower than the 2nd cosmic velocity? Say, a rocket launches and reaches a sustainable speed of 2,000 km/h. What would happen?",
    "answer": "The \" 2nd cosmic velocity\"  is the escape velocity of earth that is 11.2 kilometers per second.  The speed is for a ballistic object on the surface of the earth if you ignore air resistance. So fire a shell from a cannon at 11.2km/s straight up and it escapes earth's gravitational influence if air resistance it ignored.  An important part is the escape velocity of 11.2km/s is from the surface of earth, the farther away you are from that the lower the escape velocity is  The escape velocity is not the speed a propelled object needs to go. Take a rocker that moves straight up at 1km/h and it will escape earth, it is very fuel inefficient because the rocket counteracts earth gravity all the time, at a constant speed all energy is used to counteract gravity, If the speed in increased to 2km/h the time is halved and a lot less fuel is required to counteract gravity. The faster you go the shorter the time and less fuel is used to counteract gravity.  So there is never a requirement to travel at 11.2km/s to escape earth, you can go at any speed you like along as can maintain that speed the required time.  You will technically reach escape velocity as some point. The reason is escape velocity depends on the distance from earth so it decreases when you get away from earth. So at some point the escape velocity will be 1km/h and the the slow rocket reach it. At that point you can turn of the engine.  The escape velocity is v=sqrt(2 *G *M /d) where G it the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object you art trying to escape and d  is the distance from the center.  For earth surface we get v=sqrt(2 * 6.67 * 10^-11 *  5.9722 * 10^24 /6371000) = 11182m/s   We can solve it for when 2000km/h = 555m/s is escape velocity with the 555=sqrt(2 * 6.67 * 10^-11 *  5.9722 * 10^24 /d)  => d=2.58 * 10^9m = 2.5 million km  That is 6.7x the distance to the moon.  So the rocket that travels at 2000km/h can turn of the engine when it is 6.7x the distance to the moon from earth.   This calculation is a bit simplified because it assumes just earth and ignores the sun and earth's orbit around it. The Lagrange point 2 that JWST orbit is 1.5 million km from earth and if you get just beyond it you will be orbiting the sun instead of earth.",
    "follow-up": ">So there is never a requirement to travel at 11.2km/s to escape earth, you can go at any speed you like along as can maintain that speed the required time.  Then why do the rockets launch as fast as they do? Would it not be more efficient and safer to go slower?",

    "answer": "Well, no diagnosis doesn't mean no mental illness. SSRIs and SNRIs change the way the brain's chemical transmitters, called neurotransmitters, function. In a person with depression, this effectively compensates for too little seratonin and norepinephrine being delivered to the receptors of the chemicals.  Since doctors are not able to simply measure the chemical levels in the brain (that I know of - they definitely don't do that in the diagnosis or treatment in depression, anxiety, etc. patients), it's often a doctor's educated guess followed by trial and error in prescribing you the right medication. If the medication isn't doing what it's intended to do, you will likely suffer from some of the MANY side effects known to be caused by these medications. Increased depression, suicidal ideation, loss of appetite, loss of sexual drive or function, nausea, sweating, dry mouth, headaches. This is just the medication making unhelpful changes in brain chemistry.  Edit: and I kind of said this in different words, but the guy above me is right. they don't fully understand how the medications *specifically* affect the brain, nor do we know *specifically* what is happening in someone's brain with a mental disorder. these medications are just the most effective we have come up with - they're used, many times in combination with multiple drugs, for a wide array of issues.

Of course, you can step on the gas to go back up to the same RPM you had before, but you'll be going faster.  The input RPM is not fully independent of the gear ratio.

    "answer": "No. There is no reliable way to lose weight and keep it off. The more you try, the more likely you will weigh more than you do now in 5 years' time. This is why no program in the entire multi-billion dollar weight loss industry keeps statistics on everyone who signs up and and checks how they're doing 5 years later. It's not just that those statistics are corporate secrets. The statistics do not exist. The charlatans know better than to keep a smoking gun lying around. At most, they will keep very carefully culled statistics in which they remove all the people who \"failed\" their program (by, you know, not losing weight or not keeping it off) and only let you look at the successes. They won't tell you that the successes constitute less than 5 percent of those who enrolled.  Attempting to lose weight is one of the worst things you can do for your health. Concentrate on trying to eat healthy and to exercise and your body will decide on a weight for you. This will almost certainly be more than you would care to weigh for three reasons: 1) Because WHO and NIH have set a standard for what constitutes a healthy weight that has no basis in science. (The committees who set these standards are staffed by people who benefit financially from the multi-billion dollar weight loss industry.) Their standard is lower than what the science supports.  2) Society has bought into the nonsense about healthy weight as well as too-thin beauty standards. A normal healthy weight will look overweight to most people.  3) Your body has a certain \"set point\", a weight that it will naturally stabilize at. You've already been trying to lose weight which is one almost sure way to make sure that your body adopts a higher set point. If you hadn't subjected it to periods of enforced famine, it wouldn't have felt the need to pack on some extra insurance pounds. You probably can't change your body's current set point to a lower number. What you *can* do is convince your body to adjust that set point upward. Just continue the attempt to lose weight.  Imagine this. You have a physical condition that is associated with a mildly increased mortality risk. There is a \"treatment\" for this condition that works less than 5 percent of the time (and even when it \"works\", there's not a lot of hard data showing that it will lower your mortality risk. There's just a mostly false assumption that people who had this condition and have it no longer are just as healthy as those who never had it). In 95 percent of the cases, the end result will be a greater mortality risk than the patient had before attempting the treatment. Would it be ethical for your doctor to recommend that you attempt the treatment? Would it be ethical for your doctor to recommend it without even telling you that you will most likely *increase* your mortality risk?

The ITER reactor currently being built is the most funded fusion project. It aims to reach 10x break even for 5-10 mins at a time. ITER won\u2019t produce electricity because it doesn\u2019t have a turbine - the heat generated will just be discarded. But if it succeeds, we\u2019ll be able to build another reactor (DEMO) which will be even more effective. The roadmap includes a third reactor, PROTO, which will serve as an actual power plant, with turbines and other equipment to produce electricity.  There\u2019s still a *lot* that needs to be done before we see commercial fusion power plants.   - Reach 10x break-even on energy out/energy in - Sustain the reaction for long enough at a time to be practical. The expectation is for reactors to run continuously instead of mere seconds at a time.  - Effectively breed tritium in sufficient quantities, as this is required to fuel the reactors. The fusion reactors themselves are being designed to breed their own tritium. - Develop new materials that can survive facing the inside of the reactor chamber for long enough to be practical  - Develop methods to perform remote maintenance/material replacement on the highly irradiated reactor chamber  These barriers are pretty significant, but it\u2019s all at least theoretically possible. Hopefully it\u2019ll also be economically feasible to run them commercially. Fusion does have to compete with other low carbon methods of generation e.g. solar+wind+energy storage.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why should knives not be cleaned in the dish washer? (How can water make them dull?)",
    "answer": "Things bounce around in the dish washer, your blade is knocking off other things which can over time lead to tiny chips, bends etc. And leaving them in water causes oxidization and degrades the edge over time.  A knife is sharp because the edge is very thin and straight. When things happen to make it less straight or less thin it becomes less sharp.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does \"grading on a curve\" work, and why would a teacher want to do so?",
    "answer": "It means that the top 10% of grades get an A, the next 20% get a B etc. Not those numbers specifically, but the grade boundaries aren't rigidly based on number of correct answers but rather its relative to everyone else taking the exam.  It has downsides, but one advantage is that it smoothes over undulations in difficulty over time - if one year group happens to get an unusually difficult paper, they should in theory all get the same results as if it were an easy paper.",
    "follow-up": "So the teacher just grades one group in the one way and another group a different way, despite having the same assignment?",
